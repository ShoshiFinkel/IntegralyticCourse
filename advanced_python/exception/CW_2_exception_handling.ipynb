    "You are opening a new store! Your store sells __________________. Your job is to write a program for your new store that does the following:\n",
    "1. Tells the customer what goods can be purchased in your store. Include at least 5 items.\n",
    "2. Asks the customer for input of which item they would like to purchase, and how many of that item.\n",
    "3. Responds to the customers request with the price of the item, asks the customer for confirmation of the item, adds the item and quantity to an order list, and asks the customer if they would like to order anything else.\n",
    "4. Raise an exception if the customer inputs an item that is not part of your list.\n",
    "5. Use at least two try/excepts in your program. \n",
    "6. At the end, print out an order list with the customer's total bill. Hint: You may want to include a try/except here - when you are multiplying the item cost by the quantity, if something goes wrong with the calculation you can raise an exception error to tell the customer that there is an issue with that item and they should speak to customer service :)\n",
